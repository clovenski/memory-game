# Memory Game

This is a simple memory game where you select tiles in the grid and try to match two that are the same.

## Notes

If your second choice does not match your first choice, the second choice will not be shown.

You have 10 lives and each mismatch will cost you 1 life.

I developed this using Chrome, and I have personally seen bugs occur when using IE and Edge.
